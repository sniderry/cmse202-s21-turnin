    "\n",
    "By the end of this assignment, you should be able to:\n",
    "* Use `git` to track your work and turn in your assignment\n",
    "* Read in data and prepare it for modeling\n",
    "* Build, fit, and evaluate an SVC model of data\n",
    "* Use PCA to reduce the number of important features\n",
    "* Build, fit, and evaluate an SVC model of PCA-transformed data\n",
    "* Systematically investigate the effects of the number of PCA components on an SVC model of data\n",
